# 🌐 WebHook

A powerful, multi-purpose **Webhook Interaction & Signal System** built using Node.js, Python, PHP, Bash, and more. This tool allows you to:

- Capture webhooks from any source (browser, device, service)
- Monitor and log real-time events
- Send signals to parent servers
- Initiate client-server connections (e.g., with Netcat)
- Automate setup via shell script (Termux-ready)
- Bridge front-end & back-end workflows with ease

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nxneeraj-webhook.git
cd nxneeraj-webhook
```

### 2. Start the Webhook Server

```bash
npm install
node server.js
```

Server will start at: `http://localhost:3000`

### 3. Test via Browser

Open `index.html` in any browser — it’ll auto-trigger a POST request to the webhook server.

### 4. Use Termux Setup (Optional)

Run this inside Termux to get started:

```bash
bash shh.sh
```

This installs:

* Node.js
* Python & pip
* Git, curl, nano, and many more essentials
* Grants storage permission
* Prepares your mobile environment for serious action
